bug to track files in the data folder","messageBody":".gitignore includes the path data/ which is supposed to refer to the local storage folder only, but is also the name of the package containing data classes such as Task.\n\nThe common name between the local storage folder and data package causes the data package to be ignored by git as the data/ path is included in .gitignore.\n\nChanging the name of the local storage folder and replacing the data/ path in .gitignore with the new path to the local storage folder allows git to ignore the local storage folder only, while the data package is included in the git repository.\n\nLet\u0027s rename the local storage folder to storageFolder, replace data/ in .gitignore with storageFolder/ and assign \"storageFolder\" to the constant DEFAULT_STORAGE_FOLDER_NAME in the Storage class.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":576,"deletions":1}}},{"hash":"fdd6ff43d13fff69b60d1b022eee74761e7d38e8","messageTitle":"Add

to places in the code which work only when certain assumptions about the program state are met.\n\nAssertions are used instead of exceptions to check the internal logic of the code and ensure that it is correct, whereas exceptions are thrown for situations outside of the programmer\u0027s

representing deadlines and events in local storage file","messageBody":"Assertion errors are thrown from the factory methods in Deadline and Event classes indicating that the strings representing deadlines and events in the local storage file do not have the correct date and time format. There is a mistake in the assert statement - it assumes that the strings in the local storage follow the format for user input when in fact the user input format and the file format are different. After fixing this mistake, another bug is discovered - the parsing of deadlines and events from the local storage file is incorrect and inadvertently adds an extra white space between the date and time.\n\nTo prevent the assertion error, the incorrect assert statements should first be removed. Then, to ensure that the deadlines and events are parsed correctly from the storage file, the relevant methods in the Deadline and Event classes should be fixed.\n\nLet\u0027s remove the assert statements in the factory methods of Deadline and Event. Let\u0027s also change the methods used to parse the date and time of deadlines and events in the Deadline and Event classes.\n\nThe assert statements in the factory methods of Deadline and Event are temporarily removed until a good method to check if the strings in the local storage file follow the file format is found.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":4,"deletions":8}}},{"hash":"1ffbe96b6fb999da917db7eff909978e32d0c13c","messageTitle":"TaskList class: change the find method to enable better search (partial matching of keywords)","messageBody":"The logic for executing the Find command is inside the find method of the TaskList class. The current find method only returns tasks that match all the inputted keywords. This limits the function of find as users may enter multiple keywords and the number of tasks that contain all those keywords in the inputted order may be few / none.\n\nChanging the find method in the TaskList class to return tasks that match one or more of the keywords instead of all of them increases the number of matching tasks returned.\n\nLet\u0027s change the find method in the TaskList class to add matching tasks for each inputted keyword to the returned string.\n\nReturning the tasks that match one or more keywords improves the search quality and efficiency (users do not have to enter multiple Find commands for each keyword).\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":31,"deletions":22}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"honganhcs":{"java":1559,"md":2,"fxml":35,"sh":0,"bat":1,"gradle":18,"txt":21}},"authorContributionVariance":{"honganhcs":91431.3},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"honganhcs":"CS2103T-W13-2 NGUY..
