The code was refactored into different packages. All the code\nis in the overarching duke package, and each subpackage aims to serve a\nspecific function for the program. E.g. duke.info stores all the\ninformation required for the program (Calendar, Tasks, Exceptions) and\nthe duke.ui package handles the reading and writing from user input.\n\nLet\u0027s\n* Refactor the code into separate packages for better organization\n* Use parent abstract classes to abstract out common functionalities\n* Use a Text file to store all standard output messages\n","tags":["A-Packages","A-MoreOOP"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":566,"deletions":228},"bat":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1},"sh":{"insertions":1,"deletions":1}}},{"hash":"20017391ed52771ff448a5ac3518db994993ea3e","messageTitle":"Fix bug in \"unmark\" command","messageBody":"Previously, there was a bug where the unmark command did not mark the\njob as incomplete, but instead marked the job as complete due to an\nerroneous call of markAsDone() instead of markAsNotDone().\n\nThis commit changes the method call to properly reflect the action of\nmarking the task as incomplete.\n\nLet\u0027s\n* Fix the unmark command to properly carry out the desired functionality\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2}}}]},{"date":"2022-01-22","commitResults":[{"hash":"c3cf1ce4d7a5d6d1646224e8ca8d514b6af4b1ec","messageTitle":"Add save functionality when Calendar chanes","messageBody":"Previously, the list of tasks in the Calendar was deleted when the\nprogram exits. This meant that the user would lose all the information\nabout the tasks after each run of the program.\n\nTo make the usage of the program more meaningful, a save functionality\nwas added that saves the current list of tasks to \"tasks.txt\" in the\nmain program folder whenever the task list is updated. This makes the\nprogram more meaningful to use, as there is persistent information that\nusers can use between each program run.\n\nLet\u0027s\n* Add a save function to allow users to keep their progress\n* Add a load function to automatically load a previous save on startup\n* Use a \"tasks.txt\" file in the main directory to store progress\n","tags":["Level-7"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":3,"deletions":0},"java":{"insertions":81,"deletions":18}}}]}]},"authorFileTypeContributionMap":{"zechajw":{"java":653,"md":0,"fxml":0,"sh":1,"bat":1,"gradle":0,"txt":15}},"authorContributionVariance":{"zechajw":59765.438},"authorDisplayNameMap":{"zechajw":"CS2103T-W13-4 ZECH..
